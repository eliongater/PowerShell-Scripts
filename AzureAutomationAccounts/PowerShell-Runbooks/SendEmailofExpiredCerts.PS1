    .DESCRIPTION
        This PowerShell script is intended to be run via an Azure Automation account runbook. This script will query all Enterprise apps and App registrations and then send an email per expired certificate and secret to your ticketing system to generate a ticket.
        Note, you must import the Microsoft.Graph PowerShell module to your automation account first.
